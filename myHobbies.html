          <h2>Reading Books</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;There would be 2 big categories of my reading: the first is about
            traveling. From since when I was young, I was deeply interested in somewhat
            cultural anthropologic things and that led me to make dreams of traveling
            all around the world. So reading books of countries I wanna travel one day
            just by myself such as Honk Kong, Singapore, Northwestern Europe, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;Also, I'm quite interested in reading books of animals, especially pets.
            I love animals so wanna have it as my family but my parents really hate. So,
            beacuse of it, I'm just reading about them instead of having real one but
            thinking of having it in real one day. Either cats or dogs are all okay with me.
          </p>

        <div class="hobby">
          <h2>Listening to Music</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;When I am happy, when I am sad, when I need some concentration, or either
            when I need some my own time, anytime I need music with every kind of situations.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;Actually, I don't know the music well professionally, but anyway when I think of
            myself, probably I used to like kinda house music and electronic. Also,
            And Even more about instrumental musics. It can be from soundtracks from
            games, movies or even TV shows to originally composed in online like YouTube or
            Soundcloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;My favorite artists would be, for example, Owl City and Audiomachine.
            Owl City is usually for electronic,
            but the common thing is they're good at composing instrumentals.

          <h2>Learning Foreign Languages</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;I like global things like cultural anthropology or traveling around,
            or even it can be used in languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;I already speak 3 languages - Korean, English, Japanese. Korean is my mother
            tongue, learned English since I was very young, and started to learn Japanese
            since when I was in high school. I think my Japanese is much more fluent than
            my English. Well, just kidding.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;And thinking of learning 3 more languages from now on like German, Chinese
            and Spanish. I already took basic German class when I was in college but wanna
            learn more personally. And Chinese and Spanish are beacuse I felt some necessity
            of learning those languages after arriving U.S.
          </p>

        <h2>Watching Youtube</h2>
        <p>
          &nbsp;My best no.1 pastime nowdays. Subjects I watch is really diverse.
          It can be about makeups, pet channels, cooking, learning languages (usually English),
          or even just listening to music.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;These days I'm really interested in searching and watching videos about DMV
          just since after when I recently visited RMV. It really sucks, lol.

        <h2>Playing Games</h2>
        <p>
          &nbsp;I used to like playing games since when I was young, so until when I was in
          college sophomore, I dreamed of being game developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;Unfortunately, I lost most or my interests about games even though I made
          a game for my graduate project, but still doing a video game on my laptop called
          "The Sims 4". It's really cool for time killing.
        </p>

      <div class="hobby">
        <h2>Walking around</h2>
        <p>
          &nbsp;When I lived in Korea, I really loved walking around my town alone, especially
          in late night. Walking late gave me lots of silence and that made me much more
          concentrated to myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's really sad that I can't walk late in America because of danger. Anyway,
          beacuse of my memory before, I really love walking in downtown filled with skyscrapers
          and that makes me feel alive.
